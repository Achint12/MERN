# The Frontend (Client)

## React SPA(single page application)

React is in charge of re-rendering everything in browser only one HTML page is surfed from some server to the browser, and there after react takes over. To handle that react will use an extra library -

- Routes (with react-router-dom) - It is used to handle frontend or client side routing and this will help us render react components based on a path the user enters into the URL bar of the browser.
- State Management(hooks,redux) - State is the data that influences what is shown on the screen and if the state changes, chances are we want to re-render the parts of the screen.
