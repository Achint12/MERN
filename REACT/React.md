# React

React is basically a javascript library that is used to build reactive UI.

#### Using JavaScript isn't a good option-

- it becomes error prone
- it becomes hard to maintain or edit
- it becomes to large and heavy to use
- React offers a way simpler "mental model"

when writing anything in react user writes declarative code.

### Difference between declarative code and imperative code-

In declarative code you defined a target UI sate and not the steps needed to get there and react will figure out a way to get there. 

In case of JavaScript code one writes in imperative way which means you're not defining the goal but the steps needed to get there. 

- In react one never need's to insert script tags in the html file cause it does that automatically. They use a build process.
- build process means that the code user is writing does not go to the browser directly instead it gets transformed behind the scenes before its handed off to the browser.

# Introduction

React makes building complex interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler. It uses component that makes this easier. Components are just reusable building blocks in your user interface which are simply a combination of HTML code, css code and possibly JavaScript code for some logic.
