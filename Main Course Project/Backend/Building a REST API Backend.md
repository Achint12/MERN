with Node.js & Express





### Express 

It is a node js framework and it makes node js easier. by giving you a lot of utiliy functions parsing data easier.

bunch of functions that can be called on incoming requests and every function can do something with this incoming request or with this response which is about to be sent. but one can only send one response per request though.

### params 

this property holds an object where your dynamic segments here will exist as keys and the value will be the concrete value of the user who sent the request entered.w
